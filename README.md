# LeetCode Visualization Project

This project provides simple visualizers for common LeetCode data structures and algorithms.

## Modules

- **TreeVisualizer**  
  Visualizes binary trees (using a grid layout). Supports highlighting nodes based on input values.

- **SearchVisualizer**  
  Demonstrates grid-based search algorithms (BFS/DFS) by animating cell states.

## Future Development

- **Input Integration:** Accept custom test cases from LeetCode.
- **Additional Algorithms:** Support more visualizations (e.g., sorting, DP, advanced graph algorithms).
- **Enhanced Interactivity:** Add play/pause/step controls and UI improvements.
